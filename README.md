# Server Stats UI

Small web UI to view system info (memory, uptime, load) and list/control systemd services. Uses PHP for the API and vanilla JS for the frontend.

- **System**: memory, swap, uptime, load average (refreshes every 60s).
- **Services**: searchable list with Start / Stop / Restart.

See [HOWTODEPLOY.md](HOWTODEPLOY.md) for deployment (Apache, sudoers, HTTPS).
